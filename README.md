SDG Insight OSINT is a powerful OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to streamline cyber threat investigations by aggregating data from multiple cybersecurity intelligence sources.

SDG Insight is a powerful OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to streamline cyber threat investigations by aggregating data from multiple cybersecurity intelligence sources. Built for SOC analysts, cybersecurity professionals, and threat hunters, SDG Insight automates the process of retrieving and analyzing intelligence on IP addresses, domains, URLs, and file hashes from industry-leading APIs.

The tool integrates with VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Shodan, Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), Hybrid Analysis, and URLScan.io, ensuring comprehensive intelligence gathering for cyber threat analysis, incident response, and digital forensics.

Key Features:
Automated IOC Detection – Input any IP, domain, URL, or hash, and SDG Insight determines its type and runs the appropriate OSINT checks.
Multi-Source Intelligence Gathering – Fetches data from multiple cybersecurity APIs to provide a well-rounded investigation.
VirusTotal Integration – Checks file hashes and URLs against VirusTotal’s massive malware database.
AbuseIPDB & Shodan Analysis – Retrieves reputation scores and security insights on IP addresses.
Hybrid Analysis Lookup – Analyzes file hashes for malware reports.
URLScan.io Integration – Submits and retrieves real-time scans of URLs to detect phishing and malicious websites.
WHOIS Lookups – Retrieves domain registration details for tracking ownership and age.
Formatted Reports – Results are structured in an easy-to-read format, making analysis quick and efficient.

How It Works:
Enter an IOC (Indicator of Compromise) – Simply type in an IP, domain, URL, or file hash.
SDG Insight automatically identifies its type – No need to specify whether it’s an IP, hash, or domain.
The tool runs relevant OSINT queries – Queries VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Shodan, URLScan.io, Hybrid Analysis, and WHOIS as needed.
Results are displayed in a clear, structured format – Making it easy to assess threats.

Example Use Cases:
Incident Response – Investigate suspicious IP addresses, URLs, and file hashes linked to security incidents.
Threat Intelligence – Gather intelligence on malicious domains and compromised credentials.
Digital Forensics – Analyze artifacts from security breaches or phishing campaigns.
SOC Operations – Quickly retrieve threat reputation data for potential security threats.

Why Use SDG Insight?
Time-Saving Automation – Eliminates the need for manual OSINT lookups.
Comprehensive Coverage – Aggregates intelligence from multiple top-tier cybersecurity sources.
User-Friendly – Input a single IOC, and the tool does the rest.
Scalable & Extensible – Can be expanded to include more OSINT APIs in the future.
